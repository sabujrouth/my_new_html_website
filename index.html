            <p>
                Friendships are born in a million different ways, and all good friends strive to achieve the same goal:
                to be a source of love and support.
                Finding a true friend feels like a gift that keeps on giving, even when they are thousands of miles
                away.
                Through stressful classes, figuring out a career, and inevitable breakups, your best friends have been
                there.
                And yes, when you got those bangs you shouldn’t have tried in the first place, they consoled you.<br>

                The Role of Friendship
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the writings of Aristotle, seen in Nicomachean Ethics, it is evident that Aristotle believes that
                friendship is necessary for a virtuous and therefore happy life.
                I believe that this is accurate due to the similar conditions necessary for a complete friendship and a
                happy life. It is also evident that friendship is useful in achieving a happy life because friendship
                can make performing virtuous actions easier.
                His interpretation can be misunderstood and mistakes in practice can be made, so we will need to discuss
                these follies as well, in order to understand all the effects of friendship on achieving a happy life.
